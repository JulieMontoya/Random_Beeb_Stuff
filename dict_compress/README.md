#dict_compress#
Host-side dictionary-based text compression for text adventure games or similar.

Perl scripts are used to create BeebAsm source code which can be `INCLUDE`d from the uncompression source.

The uncompression subroutine accepts a message number in A and displays the uncompressed form of the message.
